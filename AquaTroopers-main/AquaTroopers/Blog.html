	<h1>Types of aquaculture</h1>
	
	<h2>Mariculture</h2>
	
	<p>Mariculture is a specialized branch of aquaculture (which includes freshwater aquaculture) involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean of offshore aquaculture, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater. It is commonly known as marine farming also. An example of the latter is the farming of marine fish, including finfish and shellfish like prawns, or oysters and seaweed in saltwater ponds. Non-food products produced by mariculture include: fish meal, nutrient agar, jewellery and etc.</p>
	
	<h2>Freshwater Culture</h2>
	
	<p>Aquaculture has been defined in many ways. It has been called
	as the rearing of aquatic organisms under controlled or semi controlled
	condition - thus it is underwater agriculture. The other definition of
	aquaculture is the art of cultivating the natural product of water, the
	raising or fattening of fish in enclosed ponds. Another one is simply
	the large-scale husbandry or rearing of aquatic organisms for commercial
	purposes. Aquaculture can be a potential means of reducing over need
	to import fishery products, it can mean an increased number of jobs,
	enhanced sport and commercial fishing and a reliable source of protein
	or the future.</p>
